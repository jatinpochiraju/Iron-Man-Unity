A Unity-based simulation featuring Iron Man, showcasing 3D modeling, animation, and basic interactivity. This project includes a textured Iron Man model and a C# script to control its behavior.

üõ†Ô∏è Features (Expanded)

ü¶æ 3D Iron Man Model  
The project features a detailed 3D model of Iron Man, imported as an `.fbx` file (`Iron_Man_Texture.fbx`). This model is enhanced with high-quality textures (`Iron_Man_Texture.png`) to closely resemble the iconic suit from the Marvel franchise. The model can be easily imported into Unity scenes and used for animation, interaction, or cinematic purposes.

üéÆ Custom Controller Script  
The `ironman.cs` script provides the functionality for controlling Iron Man‚Äôs actions and movements within the Unity scene. It serves as the core logic behind Iron Man‚Äôs interactivity, handling basic behaviors such as movement, rotation, and other potential gameplay elements. This script is written in C# and can be easily customized or extended based on your simulation or game logic requirements.

üñºÔ∏è Visual Preview  
A static visual reference (`Screenshot.png`) is included in the project to offer a quick look at the rendered Iron Man model within the Unity Editor. This preview helps new users or contributors quickly understand what the final in-game scene should look like and serves as a reference point during development or testing.
